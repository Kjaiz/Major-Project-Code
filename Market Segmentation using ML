Abstract: Market segmentation is an approach whose aim is to identify and outline the market segments on which an organization can target for its marketing plans. 
Market Segmentation is used not only for selling a commodity and various services but also plays a crucial role in meeting the customer’s needs because without customers there is no business.
So satisfying a customer’s need is really important and hence the need for market segmentation. The general objective of this research service is to analyze various factors which influence
the student’s admission process in various private institutions. Various factors like teaching staff, quality of education, and facilities play an important role in influencing students
while selecting a college or university. But as Technology is increasing, we can say digital advertisement also plays an important role in luring a student to select a particular
college/university through various online platforms such as websites, emails, etc., and just like that several factors need consideration. So the main aim of this research is to analyze all 
the factors and their broad segments which can be used by various higher education managers to develop strategies and customize their plans for making their businesses more profitable. 
A student survey allows students to share their issues, needs, and desires, giving feedback on how a teacher can change his or her instruction to help them perform better in class. 
By implementing certain measures, it is possible to enhance student engagement and motivation, resulting in better academic outcomes and higher levels of student achievement.
